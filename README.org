#+TITLE: Tamanduauth Backend

* Intro
Hi! This repository contains the code for the TamanduAuth backend application.

The project is in a /very early/ stage. Don't take anything for granted in the
current stage.

* Running the server
** Requirements
- A nightly Rust toolchain (you'll probably want to install using =rustup.rs=)
- Docker + docker-compose
- A SMTP server
   For development, you can use the following command:
   #+BEGIN_SRC
$ sudo python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:25
   #+END_SRC
   Yes, as root. Yes, you can roll your eyes.
- =sqlx-cli= installed. You can do this using the following command:
  #+BEGIN_SRC
$ cargo install sqlx-cli
  #+END_SRC
** Running (development)
First, use =docker-compose= to bringup the database:

  #+BEGIN_SRC
$ docker-compose up -d
  #+END_SRC

Wait for the database to load, then run the migrations:

  #+BEGIN_SRC
$ sqlx migrate run
  #+END_SRC

After the migrations have run, you can compile and start the server using Cargo:

  #+BEGIN_SRC
$ cargo run
  #+END_SRC
